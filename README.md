Bindings of [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org) for PHP using FFI (no custom extensions needed!).

## How to use

- Obtain the CSFML binaries for your platform (https://github.com/SFML/CSFML)
- Create an SFML object with the path of the appropriate `.so` (Linux), `.dylib` (Mac) or `.dll` (Windows) library files
- Call functions and have fun!  Make sure to stay away from `@internal` stuff - there be ~~demons~~ implementation details!
